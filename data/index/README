This directory contains the structural files of the 195 protein-ligand 
complexes included in the PDBbind coreset v.2013, which are required in the 
"scoring power" test as well as the "ranking power" test.

Each complex is saved in a subdirectory named after its PDB code: 
 
    e.g. 1bxo/
 
The crystal complex structure from PDB is split into a protein molecule saved in 
the PDB format and the Tripos Mol2 format: 
 
    e.g. 1bxo_protein.pdb & 1bxo_protein.mol2
 
The ligand molecule in the complex is saved in the Tripos Mol2 format and the 
MDL SDF format:
 
    e.g. 1bxo_ligand.mol2 & 1bxo_ligand.sdf

Besides, the ligand molecule was optimized in situ and the results are given as: 
    e.g. 1bxo_ligand_opt.mol2 & 1bxo_ligand_opt.sdf

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two index files under the "index/" directory, which summarize the
basic information of the PDBbind coreset v.2013:

"2013_core_data.lst": List of the protein-ligand complexes in the core set, 
providing formatted binding data by protein clusters.
 
"2013_core_name.lst": List of the protein-ligand complexes in the core set, 
providing EC number and name of the protein in each complex.
